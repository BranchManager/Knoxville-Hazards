With our easy to use crowdsourced interface, the Knoxville community can kept up-to-date in real time! link

# Inspiration
It is important to stay in touch with your local area and be aware of what is going on in your community. With 50% of our team growing up in Knoxville, we know how difficult it can be to find out what is happening in the area, especially finding all the information you need in one place. Occurrences such as cable and internet issues can be difficult to pin point. Is it just you? Or are your neighbors having the same issue? Maybe there is black ice on the roadway in the winter. Let others know they may not want to go that route! Or even want to encourage your children's young entrepreneurial spirits? Wouldn't it be great to have a way to spread the word about their lemonade stand? KNX NBHD would be a solution to get information quickly to the community and have all information grouped in one place.

# Learning Experiences and Challenges
As a team we learned the ins and outs of web-development, java script, and use of multiple API platforms. 3/4 of our team did not have previous experience with this type of project. This posed a great challenge for trying to learn the necessary tools and create a functional, presentable project in the time given. Specific challenges we faced were integrating the database platform to the website, as well as, manipulating embedded maps to perform in the specified manner.

# Future
If we were to continue to develop this website, then there are a few different things that we would do to improve it. Firstly, we would add a way for users to ask for help from others in the Knoxville community. From simple things like tech trouble or even tutors to bigger things like tearing down houses, it would be a great way to find help from your fellow Knoxvillians. Another thing we would implement is location services. This would allow users to submit a post without having to specify their location.
